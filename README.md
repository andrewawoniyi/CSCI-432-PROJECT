**[README] - Grade Book Implementation**

This code is an implementation of a grade book. Through the use of a relational database, it allows an instructor to manage different courses, students, assignments, and grades. It stores all this information through the use of a SQL implementation. Below are the instructions to compile & execute the code:

NOTE: Before attempting to use this implementation, ensure you have an SQL DBMS installed either on a local machine, or a remote server






**Step 1:** 

Using an SQL client such as MySQL Workbench, connect to your DBMS.


**Step 2:** 

Begin the implementation by creating a schema.


**Step 3:** 

Ensuring the schema is selected, run the first block of code to create the first table.


**Step 4:** 

Repeat the previous step on the next three blocks of code to create the remaining tables.


**Step 5:** 

Using the comments as a guide, run each remaining block of code sequentially to insert values into the tables & manipulate the data within.
